<h1>Fenxi</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<P>
   Fenxi is a pluggable Java-based post-processing, performance analysis tool.
   The Fenxi performance analysis tool eases the processing and analysis of 
   performance data and benchmark results. Fenxi parses and loads the data from
   a variety of tools into a database, and then runs a set of
   queries to analyze and plot the results. Fenxi also allows you to compare
   performance metrics from a set of runs, and run your own custom queries.
</P>
<P>
Let us assume that we are trying to improve the performance of a
particular benchmark. The usual practice is to tune a parameter,
do a run, and verify if that change helped improve performance.
To ease performance analysis, we need a tool that understands the
data that is generated and is able to answer certain questions regarding
this data. For example, we might want to know what changed in the
performance metrics as a result of applying this tuning, or find out
if this run is statistically different from a previous run. We may also be
interested in more detailed statistics.
For ex, if we are interested in memory utilization, we may want
to know the peak and average memory utilization during the whole run.
Using traditional tools, this means that we write a specific tool to answer this
question. Ideally we want to able to answer these questions without resorting
to writing a new tool or spending too much time in getting this data. 
Answering arbitrary questions means that we store the data in a <i>queryable</i>
format,
and that we have a language for asking questions. Rather than reinvent the
wheel, 
In Fenxi, we store the data in the database, and questions are formulated in
SQL.

<H2>How can I use Fenxi</h2>
Download the <a href="/files/documents/7639/84930/fenxi-2.1a.tar.bz2">fenxi-2.1a</a> fenxi tarball and untar it.

To process some data or a benchmark run stored in a directory <TT>Run1</TT>,
or to process a file called Run1, you can use
<pre>
$FENXI_HOME/dist/scripts/fenxi process Run1 Run1_html "first run"
</pre>
The output is generated in the <tt>Run1_html</tt> directory
